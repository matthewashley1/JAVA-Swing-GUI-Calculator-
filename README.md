# JAVA-Swing-GUI-Calculator-

This program is a work in progress Calculator using JAVA Swing. I am new to JAVA Swing and this is a project for a way to learn. Any changes and additions to improve the program are welcome.

Currently have all numbers working with decimal places as well as basic functions (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication). Working on adding some scientific functions where you have a drop down menu and can set the calculator to scientific mode. Also want to add parentheses and ability to do equations.
