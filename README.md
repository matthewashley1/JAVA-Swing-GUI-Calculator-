# JAVA-Swing-GUI-Calculator-

This program is a work in progress Calculator using JAVA Swing. I am new to JAVA Swing and this is a project for a way to learn. Any changes and additions to improve the program are welcome.

Currently have all numbers working as well as basic functions (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication). Working on adding in decimal places and hopefully some scientific functions soon. Also want to add parentheses and ability to do equations.
